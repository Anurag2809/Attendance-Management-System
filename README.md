Attendance management is important to every single organization; it can decide 
whether or not an organization such as educational institutions, public or private 
sectors will be successful in the future. Organizations will have to keep a track 
of people within the organization such as employees and students to maximize 
their performance. Managing student attendance during lecture periods has 
become a difficult challenge. The ability to compute the attendance percentage 
becomes a major task as manual computation produces errors, and wastes a lot 
of time. For the stated reason, an efficient Program for attendance management 
system is designed to track student’s activity in the class. This application takes 
attendance electronically and the records of the attendance are storing in a 
database. The system design using the Model, View, and Controller (MVC) 
architecture, and implemented using the power of JAVA and MYSQL Data 
Base. Java Data Base Driver(JDBC) is adding to the Program to improve the 
use of the system. MySQL used for the Program Database. The system designed 
in a way that can differentiate Sectors of branches since the rate of them is 
different for calculating the percentages of the students’ absence. Insertions, 
deletions, and changes of data in the system can do straightforward via the 
Program Input and Output without interacting with the tables. Different 
presentation of information is obtainable from the system. The test case of the 
system exposed that the system is working enormously and is ready to use to 
manage to attend students for any department of the University.
